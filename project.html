            <h2>Java Project</h2>
            <p>This project is a Java-based memory game that challenges players to match pairs of cards. The game is designed to test and improve the player's memory and concentration skills. The interface displays a grid of cards, each with a hidden symbol. When a player clicks on a card, it flips to reveal the symbol. If the player finds two cards with matching symbols, they remain flipped; if not, the cards turn back over after a short delay.</p>
            <p>To enhance the gaming experience, the game includes various difficulty levels, allowing players to choose the grid size and complexity that best suits their skill level. It also features a timer to track how quickly players can match all pairs, encouraging them to improve their performance with each play</p>

            <h2>Java Project</h2>
            <p>This Java application is designed to teach children how to cook simple and fun recipes. The app provides step-by-step instructions with engaging visuals and interactive elements to make cooking easy and enjoyable for kids. Each recipe includes ingredient lists, cooking steps, and helpful tips to ensure a safe and educational cooking experience.</p>
            <p>Unlike watching cooking videos on YouTube, this Java application offers an interactive and immersive learning experience tailored specifically for children. Students can actively participate in the cooking process by following step-by-step instructions at their own pace, rather than passively watching a video.</p>

            <h2>Photography and Videography</h2>
            <p>In this project, I provided professional photography and videography services to real estate agents, enhancing their property listings with high-resolution images, detailed video tours, and stunning aerial shots. Utilizing DSLR cameras, drones, and professional lighting equipment, I captured properties in the best light, regardless of weather conditions. Post-production editing using Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, and After Effects ensured a polished final product. This project improved property presentation, increased engagement rates, and received positive client feedback for the visual content's quality and effectiveness.</p>
